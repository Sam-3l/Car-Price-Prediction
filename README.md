## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the prices of cars based on various features and attributes. Predicting car prices can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. Buyers can use this model to estimate fair prices, while sellers can optimize pricing strategies to attract potential buyers.

## Project Description

In this project, we have developed a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib to predict car prices. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. By analyzing and processing this data, we can make accurate price predictions.

## Dataset

We used the [Car Price Dataset](link_to_dataset) for this project. This dataset includes information about various car features and their corresponding prices. You can download the dataset from [source](link_to_dataset) and place it in the `data` directory.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
